## Ques1. What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in Python? Provide an example for each.
### '==' is used to check equality conditions or for doing comparisons. for example 1 == 2 - checks whether 1 is equal to 2 or not? so basically it will return false as 1 is not equal to 2. 
### '=' is used to assign purpose. i.e. assigning values to some variable. for example, name = 'vishal' . This will basically assign 'vishal' to variable called name.

## Ques2. Explain the concept of mutability of objects in Python with suitable examples.
### Mutability in python means once object is created it can be further modified, updated or altered. for example, array or list in python.
### Immutability in python means once object is created you cannot further modify, update or alter anything to it. for example, strings in python.

## Ques3. How is a ternary conditional operator used in Python? Provide an example.
## Ques4. What is the purpose of the 'pass' statement in Python? Provide a code example.
## Ques5. What are the different logical operators available in Python? Provide examples for each.
## Ques6. Explain the difference between 'and' and '&' operators in Python with examples.
### 'and' is used for logical conjunction. example 
#### x = 5
#### y = 10
#### z = 15
#### if x < y and y < z:
####     print("Both conditions are true")
#### else:
####     print("At least one condition is false")

### while '&' is used for performing bitwise AND operation on integers. for example
#### x = 5
#### y = 3 
#### result = x & y  # binary representation: 0001 (1 in decimal)
#### print("Bitwise AND result:", result)
## Ques7. What is the 'in' keyword used for in Python? Provide an example.
## Ques8. What are the different comparison operators in Python? Provide examples for each.
## Ques9. How does the 'not' operator work in Python? Provide an example.
## Ques10. Explain the concept of short-circuit evaluation in Python with an example.
